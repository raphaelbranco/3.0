                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>
        Who am I? I am an Entrepreneur and Agilist with over 20 years of experience in software development. I have a strong sense of ownership, and I always seek to increase team productivity, organize processes, and, of course, code a lot.

                        <p>
                    On the backend, I apply C#, CQRS, DDD, Microservices, NoSQL, SOLID, and other modern development practices. I use JWT, OAuth, Events, Mediator, RabbitMQ, Facade, and MS UserSecrets for secure and efficient communication between services.

                        <h2>Front-end</h2>
                        <p>
                    On the front-end, I use React, Hooks, States, Material Design, and various design patterns like Factory, Composite, and Builder. I also use SOLID and Dependency Injection principles to write scalable and maintainable code. For state management, I rely on Recoil and support for multilingualism using Axios, SCSS, and TypeScript.
