                        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                        <p>
        Who am I? I am an Entrepreneur and Agilist with over 20 years of experience in software development. I have a strong sense of ownership, and I always seek to increase team productivity, organize processes, and, of course, code a lot.

                        <h2>Backend</h2>
                        <p>
                    On the backend, I apply C#, CQRS, DDD, Microservices, NoSQL, SOLID, and other modern development practices. I use JWT, OAuth, Events, Mediator, RabbitMQ, Facade, and MS UserSecrets for secure and efficient communication between services.

                        <h2>Front-end</h2>
                        <p>
                    On the front-end, I use React, Hooks, States, Material Design, and various design patterns like Factory, Composite, and Builder. I also use SOLID and Dependency Injection principles to write scalable and maintainable code. For state management, I rely on Recoil and support for multilingualism using Axios, SCSS, and TypeScript.

                        <p>
                    I`m passionate about agile methodologies and software development lifecycle management tools. I always strive to form high-performance teams, facilitate digital transformation, and promote an agile culture.

<h2>Why so much complexity?</h2>
<p>The idea is not to build a product or something that is fully functional, but rather to demonstrate the knowledge that I currently possess regarding Front-end and Backend development.</p>
<h2>What does the code do?</h2>
<p>It has two basic structures:</p>
<p>   Authentication using JWT token</p>
<p>   Menu registration and listing</p><h2>But isn't this really DDD / Does it need to be DDD?</h2>
<p>Yes, DDD goes far beyond separating code into folders, with the use of ubiquitous language among other things, but again, the idea is to demonstrate the current knowledge I have.</p>
<h2>What are the improvements you intend to make?</h2>
<p>A lot can be improved, including issues related to responsibility segmentation. This is a first version, but it could include items related to Docker, infrastructure building, Terraforms, SonarQube, API Gateway, GRPC, Load Balancer, in short, the sky's the limit.</p>

  <h2>Detailed Backend</h2>
<h3>Software Design Patterns</h3>
<p>CQRS: Design pattern that separates data reading and writing into different models to optimize business logic.</p>
<p>DDD: Software development approach that models business objects to accurately reflect an organization's logic.</p>
<h3>Software Architecture</h3>
